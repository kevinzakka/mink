mink is a library for differential inverse kinematics in Python, based on the [MuJoCo](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco) physics engine.

Features include:

* Task specification in configuration or operational space;
* Limits on joint positions and velocities;
* Collision avoidance between any geom pair;
* Lie group interface for rigid body transformations.

For usage and API reference, see the [documentation](https://kevinzakka.github.io/mink/).

## How can I help?

Install the library, use it and report any bugs in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/kevinzakka/mink/issues) if you find any. If you're feeling adventurous, you can also check out the contributing [guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgements

mink is a direct port of [Pink](https://github.com/stephane-caron/pink) which uses [Pinocchio](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio) under the hood. St√©phane Caron, the author of Pink, is a role model for open-source software in robotics. This library would not have been possible without his work and assistance throughout this project.

mink also heavily adapts code from the following libraries:

* The lie algebra library that powers the transforms in mink is adapted from [jaxlie](https://github.com/brentyi/jaxlie).
* The collision avoidance constraint is adapted from [dm_robotics](https://github.com/google-deepmind/dm_robotics/tree/main/cpp/controllers)'s LSQP controller.
