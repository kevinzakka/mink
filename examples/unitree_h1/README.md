## URDF â†’ MJCF derivation steps

1. Added `<mujoco> <compiler discardvisual="false" strippath="false" fusestatic="false"/> </mujoco>` to the URDF's
   `<robot>` clause in order to preserve visual geometries.
2. Loaded the URDF into MuJoCo and saved a corresponding MJCF.
3. Manually edited the MJCF to extract common properties into the `<default>` section.
4. Added actuators.
5. Added `scene.xml` which includes the robot, with a textured groundplane, skybox, and haze.
